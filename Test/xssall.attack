Feature: Check for cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability using arachni against gruyere
Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
  | name              | environment_variable_name         |
  | url               | TARGET_HOSTNAME                   |
Scenario: Do a full xss
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=xss* --output-verbose --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected"
